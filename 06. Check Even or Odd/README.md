# Check Even or Odd

This project is a simple C++ program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter an integer number.
- It checks if the number is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
- The result (even or odd) is displayed to the user.

## Features

- Simple user input and output.
- Uses an `if-else` statement to determine evenness or oddness.
- Clear and user-friendly output messages.

## Example Usage

```
Check if your number is Even or ODD : 7
Number is Odd
```

## How it works

1. The program starts and asks the user to enter a number.
2. The user enters an integer.
3. The program checks if the number is divisible by 2 (using `num % 2 == 0`).
4. If true, it prints "Number Is Even"; otherwise, it prints "Number is Odd".

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using the modulus operator in C++
- Handling user input and output
- Using conditional statements (`if-else`)
