# Check Positive, Negative or Zero

This project is a simple C++ program that checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter an integer number.
- It checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements.
- The result is displayed to the user.
- If the input is not a valid integer, an error message is shown (though in this code, all integer inputs are handled).

## Features

- Simple user input and output.
- Uses `if-else` logic to determine the sign of the number.
- Clear and user-friendly output messages.

## Example Usage

```
Check if you number is "Positive", "Negative" or, "Zero"
Please Enter the Number: -7
Your Number is Negative
```

## How it works

1. The program starts and asks the user to enter a number.
2. The user enters an integer.
3. The program checks:
   - If the number is 0, it prints "Your number is only zero".
   - If the number is greater than 0, it prints "Your Number is Positive".
   - If the number is less than 0, it prints "Your Number is Negative".
4. The result is displayed to the user.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using `if-else` statements in C++
- Handling user input and output
- Understanding number sign checking
