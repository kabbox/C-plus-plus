# Sum of First N Natural Numbers

This project is a simple C++ program that calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a loop.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer N.
- It uses a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to N.
- The final sum is displayed to the user.

## Features

- User input for the number N.
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate through natural numbers.
- Accumulates the sum using a variable.
- Simple and efficient calculation.

## Example Usage

```
Please enter the N numbers to calculate Natural Numbers : 5
15
```

Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

## How it works

1. The program asks the user to enter a number N.
2. It initializes a variable `calc` to 0 to store the sum.
3. Using a `for` loop, it iterates from 1 to N.
4. In each iteration, it adds the current number to the `calc` variable.
5. After the loop completes, it displays the final sum.

## Mathematical Formula

The sum of first N natural numbers can also be calculated using the formula:
Sum = N Ã— (N + 1) / 2

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using `for` loops in C++
- Understanding loop iteration and accumulation
- Handling user input and output
- Learning about natural numbers and their sum
