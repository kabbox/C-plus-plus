# Factorial of a Number

This project is a simple C++ program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a loop.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
- It uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial of the number.
- The factorial result is displayed to the user.

## Features

- User input for the number.
- Uses a `for` loop to calculate factorial iteratively.
- Simple and efficient calculation.
- Handles positive integers.

## What is Factorial?

The factorial of a positive integer n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

- 0! = 1 (by definition)
- 1! = 1
- 2! = 2 × 1 = 2
- 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
- 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number for factorial : 5
120
```

Explanation: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

## How it works

1. The program asks the user to enter a number.
2. It initializes a variable `num` to 1 to store the factorial result.
3. Using a `for` loop, it iterates from 1 to the entered number.
4. In each iteration, it multiplies the current number with the `num` variable.
5. After the loop completes, it displays the factorial result.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using `for` loops in C++
- Understanding multiplication and accumulation
- Handling user input and output
- Learning about factorial calculations
