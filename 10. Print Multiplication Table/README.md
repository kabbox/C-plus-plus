# Print Multiplication Table

This project is a simple C++ program that prints a multiplication table for a given number up to a specified range.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter a number for which they want the multiplication table.
- It asks for the range (how many multiples to display).
- The program uses a `for` loop to calculate and display the multiplication table.
- Each line shows the multiplication in the format: `number X multiplier = result`.

## Features

- User input for the number and range.
- Uses a `for` loop to generate the table.
- Clear and formatted output display.

## Example Usage

```
Print Multiplication Table of : 5
Multiplication Table Range : 10
5 X 1 = 5
5 X 2 = 10
5 X 3 = 15
5 X 4 = 20
5 X 5 = 25
5 X 6 = 30
5 X 7 = 35
5 X 8 = 40
5 X 9 = 45
5 X 10 = 50
```

## How it works

1. The program asks the user to enter a number for the multiplication table.
2. It asks for the range (how many rows to display).
3. Using a `for` loop, it calculates each multiplication result.
4. Each result is displayed in a formatted manner.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using `for` loops in C++
- Handling user input and output
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Understanding loop iteration and formatting
