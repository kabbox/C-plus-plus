# Find Maximum of Three Numbers

This project is a simple C++ program that finds the maximum (largest) value among three numbers entered by the user.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter three integer numbers (A, B, and C).
- It uses nested `if-else` statements to compare the numbers and determine which one is the greatest.
- The program then displays which number is the greatest.

## Features

- User input for three numbers.
- Uses conditional logic to compare all three values.
- Clear and user-friendly output messages.

## Example Usage

```
Checking Maximum of 2 Numbers..
Enter First Number(A) : 5
Enter Second Number(B) : 8
Enter Third Number(C) : 3
B is Greater
```

## How it works

1. The program starts and asks the user to enter three numbers.
2. It compares the numbers using nested `if-else` statements:
   - If A > B and A > C, it prints "A is Greater".
   - If C > B and C > A, it prints "C is Greater".
   - Otherwise, it prints "B is Greater".
3. The result is displayed to the user.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using nested `if-else` statements in C++
- Handling user input and output
- Comparing multiple values
