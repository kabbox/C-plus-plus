# Find Sum of Array Elements

This project is a simple C++ program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array of integers.

## What is included in this program?

- The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array.
- It asks the user to input all elements of the array.
- The program uses a loop to iterate through all elements and calculate their sum.
- The total sum is displayed to the user.

## Features

- Dynamic array size based on user input.
- User input for all array elements.
- Uses a loop to calculate the sum of all elements.
- Simple accumulation logic to add all values.

## Example Usage

```
Enter Array Element Size : 5
Enter 5 Elements : 10 20 30 40 50
Your Array Sum is: 150
```

## How it works

1. The program asks the user to enter the array size.
2. It creates an array of the specified size.
3. The user enters all elements of the array using a loop.
4. The program initializes a `sum` variable to 0.
5. Using another `for` loop, it adds each array element to the sum.
6. After processing all elements, it displays the total sum.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize `sum` to 0.
2. Loop through all array elements.
3. Add each element to the `sum` variable.
4. Display the final sum.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Working with arrays in C++
- Using loops for array traversal
- Understanding accumulation operations
- Learning basic array algorithms
- Input/output operations with arrays
